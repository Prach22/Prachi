// The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of N daily price quotes for a stock and we need to calculate span of stockâ€™s price for all N days. You are given an array of length N, where ith element of array denotes the price of a stock on ith. Find the span of stock's price on ith day, for every 1<=i<=N.
// A span of a stock's price on a given day, i, is the maximum number of consecutive days before the (i+1)th day, for which stock's price on these days is less than or equal to that on the ith day.

// Input Format
// First line contains integer N denoting size of the array.
// Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

// Constraints
// 1 <= N <= 10^6

// Output Format
// Display the array containing stock span values.

// Sample Input
// 5
// 30
// 35
// 40
// 38
// 35
// Sample Output
// 1 2 3 1 1 END
// Explanation
// For the given case
// for day1 stock span =1
// for day2 stock span =2 (as 35>30 so both days are included in it)
// for day3 stock span =3 (as 40>35 so 2+1=3)
// for day4 stock span =1 (as 38<40 so only that day is included)
// for day5 stock span =1 (as 35<38 so only that day is included)
// hence output is 1 2 3 1 1 END
